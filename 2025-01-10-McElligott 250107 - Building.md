USD Rates more of the same “heaviness” in the Long-End, as the crowded (for the right reasons) Steepener continues to work on the “term-premium rebuild” –theme remaining intact, in-addition to the Trump rope-a-dope denial to the earlier WaPo “tariff walk-balk” story, strong US “Risk-ON” sentiment as we begin the new year, as well as the high-key January supply overload likely playing a large part via heavy UST (10Y today, 30Y bond tomorrow) and IG Corp paper coming to market (~$59B of deals incl SSA yday, now ~$76B MTD, and on estimates for ~$150-200B for the total month of January)

美元利率方面，長端仍然呈現「沉重」的走勢，這主要是因為市場普遍（且有充分理由）押注的「陡峭化交易」持續發揮作用，推動「期限溢價重建」的主題不變。此外，還有以下幾個因素：

- 川普否認先前《華盛頓郵報》關於他對關稅立場軟化的報導，這可以視為一種「虛晃一槍」的策略。
- 新年伊始，美國市場的「風險偏好」情緒強烈。
- 一月份大量的新債發行很可能在其中扮演了重要角色，具體表現為大量的美國國債（今天發行10年期國債，明天發行30年期國債）和投資級公司債券湧入市場（包括昨日的機構債在內，交易額約為590億美元，本月迄今約為760億美元，預計整個一月份的發行總額將達到1500億至2000億美元）。

總而言之，多重因素共同作用，導致美元利率長端承壓。

Piling-on with the overall Rates selloff is of course the US ISM Services Prices Paid upside blowout to highs since 2023 and further contributing to that “upside inflation risk” – Tail (even though the JOLTS “Quit Rate” decline offers some much smaller respite)  

加劇整體利率拋售的因素，當然還有美國ISM服務業支付價格指數意外飆升至2023年以來的最高點，這進一步加劇了「通膨上行風險」的尾部風險（儘管JOLTS職位空缺報告中的「離職率」下降提供了一些微弱的緩解）。

簡單來說，除了其他因素導致的利率拋售外，ISM服務業支付價格指數的大幅上漲，更加讓人擔心通膨會再次走高，雖然JOLTS報告中顯示的離職率下降帶來了一點點好消息，但相比之下影響較小。

事實是，美國國債收益率曲線終於擺脫了長達兩年半的倒掛狀態。長期以來，持有久期（以及作為首選尾部風險對沖工具的長端利率互換空頭價差）的誘惑，很大程度上是基於投資者對「痛苦增長」的預期，以及對川普政府親增長政策下「動物精神」即將復甦的看法，再加上上述通膨仍然危險地「頑固」（聯準會最初的50個基點降息現在看來很明顯是個「政策錯誤」），這些因素共同作用，使得市場一直對「衰退風險」保持警惕。

**收益率曲線不再倒掛：** 這是個重要的轉變，通常意味著經濟衰退的風險降低。

**持有久期的誘惑：** 在收益率曲線倒掛時期，持有長天期債券（即持有久期）可以獲得較高的收益。但隨著曲線不再倒掛，這種誘惑力下降。

**「痛苦增長」和「動物精神」：** 投資者之前預期經濟會經歷一段「痛苦增長」時期，然後在川普政府的親增長政策刺激下，「動物精神」（指投資者的樂觀情緒和冒險意願）會回歸，推動經濟快速增長。

The fact is that UST curves are finally exiting 2.5 years of inversion, and that the siren song of owning Duration (and Long back-end Receiver Spreads as preferred Tail hedges) for a “Hard-Landing that never comes” has been a painful trade, against a backdrop where US data has remained generally front-footed with no signs of anything close to “Recession Risk”—especially with the investor perception of pro-growth Trump policy “animal spirits” waiting in the wings and aforementioned inflation staying dangerously “sticky” (with Fed’s 50bps kick-off cut now pretty clearly looking like “policy error”)

事實是，美國國債收益率曲線終於擺脫了長達兩年半的倒掛狀態。過去，基於「硬著陸永遠不會到來」的假設，持有久期（以及作為首選尾部風險對沖工具的長端利率互換空頭價差）曾經極具吸引力，但這卻是一筆痛苦的交易，因為美國經濟數據總體表現強勁，沒有任何接近「衰退風險」的跡象——尤其是考慮到投資者普遍認為，在川普政府親增長政策的推動下，「動物精神」（指投資者的樂觀和冒險意願）隨時可能爆發，以及上述通膨仍然危險地「頑固」（聯準會最初的50個基點降息現在看來很明顯是個「政策錯誤」）。

這段話的重點在於：

- **收益率曲線不再倒掛：** 這是個重要轉變，通常預示著經濟衰退的風險降低。
- **持有久期的錯誤押注：** 過去，許多投資者押注經濟將會「硬著陸」（即經濟急劇衰退），因此持有長天期債券（即持有久期）以對沖風險。然而，由於經濟表現良好，這種押注是錯誤的，導致了損失。
- **美國經濟數據強勁：** 美國經濟數據總體表現良好，沒有顯示出衰退的跡象。
- **「動物精神」的預期：** 投資者普遍認為，川普政府的親增長政策將會激發「動物精神」，推動經濟快速增長。
- **通膨頑固：** 然而，通膨仍然居高不下，這使得聯準會難以實施寬鬆的貨幣政策。
- **聯準會的政策錯誤：** 聯準會最初的50個基點降息現在看來是個錯誤的判斷，因為通膨並沒有像預期的那樣快速下降。

Conversely, and even as the market has reset 2025 “Fed cuts” probabilities powerfully lower against this “still resilient” economic backdrop, with now only a miserly ~40bps of implied Fed cuts remaining across the next 1.5 year distribution through mid / late 2026, it’s difficult to argue with the view that (back) Red- and Green- SOFR Upside is probably the best Long around from a ‘risk / reward’ perspective—especially as they help to hedge out some of the beaucoup “Long Equities” exposure for the multi-asset Real Money set—if and when the eventual payback from “high for longer” hits the economy looking out beyond 2025 and instead, further into 2026

相反地，即使市場在「仍然具有韌性」的經濟背景下，大幅降低了對2025年「聯準會降息」的預期，到2026年中/下旬的未來一年半時間裡，隱含的聯準會降息幅度僅剩下微不足道的約40個基點，也很難反駁這樣一種觀點：從「風險/回報」的角度來看，（遠期）紅色和綠色SOFR（擔保隔夜融資利率）的上行可能是目前最好的多頭策略——尤其是當它們有助於對沖多資產實質資金組合中大量「股票多頭」的曝險時——如果且當「高利率維持更長時間」的最終影響在2025年之後、而是更晚的2026年衝擊經濟時。

這段話可以總結為以下幾點：

- **降息預期大幅降低：** 由於經濟表現仍然具有韌性，市場對聯準會在2025年降息的預期大幅降低。
- **SOFR上行是較好的多頭策略：** 在這種情況下，押注遠期SOFR利率上升（即做多SOFR）可能是較好的投資策略，因為如果經濟在2026年開始受到高利率的負面影響，聯準會可能會被迫降息，從而推高SOFR價格。
- **對沖股票曝險：** 做多SOFR還可以對沖投資組合中股票多頭的風險，因為如果經濟下行，股市通常會下跌，而SOFR價格則可能上漲。
- **高利率的滯後效應：** 這段話暗示，高利率對經濟的負面影響可能需要一段時間才能顯現，可能要到2026年才會對經濟產生明顯的衝擊。

總而言之，這段話認為，在降息預期降低、經濟可能在未來受到高利率影響的情況下，做多遠期SOFR利率是一個相對較好的投資策略，既可以獲得潛在的回報，又可以對沖股票投資的風險。

Alternatively, but as a dovetail off the back of my point made above regarding “Duration” not working whatsoever right now as a “Risk Hedge” due to the UPSIDE RISKS in inflation- and growth- being perceived in US (and as an alternative to my simple “Red / Green STIRS Upside” observation ONLY IN the case of eventual economic “slowdown” -scenario)— My Nomura QIS colleagues Simon de Fauconval, Ross French, Anthony Morris and Lai Wei shared a BRILLIANT piece of work at the end of December which I want to circle back upon, as somebody who remains a prolific Managed Futures CTA -watcher and massive advocate for “Trend” strats being elite diversifiers and Tail-Hedges due to their “Positive Skew” attributes thanks to their dynamic correlation -profile

或者，延續我上面關於「久期」目前完全無法作為「風險對沖」工具的觀點（因為美國的通膨和增長存在上行風險），並且作為針對我僅在最終經濟「放緩」情境下提出的簡單「紅色/綠色短期利率上行」觀點的替代方案——我的野村QIS同事Simon de Fauconval、Ross French、Anthony Morris和Lai Wei在12月底分享了一份非常出色的研究報告，我想回顧一下。我仍然是一位多產的管理期貨CTA（商品交易顧問）觀察者，並且由於「趨勢」策略具有動態相關性帶來的「正偏態」特徵，因此我仍然是這些策略作為卓越的多樣化工具和尾部風險對沖工具的堅定支持者。

這段話可以分解為以下幾個要點：

- **久期目前不適合作為風險對沖：** 由於美國通膨和增長存在上行風險，傳統的避險工具——久期（通常指長天期債券）目前無法有效發揮作用。
- **替代方案：** 作者之前提到做多遠期短期利率（例如紅色/綠色STIRS）是個可行的策略，但前提是經濟最終會放緩。這裡他提出了另一個替代方案。
- **野村QIS團隊的研究：** 作者提到了野村QIS團隊的一份研究報告，這份報告是他接下來要重點闡述的內容。
- **管理期貨CTA和趨勢策略：** 作者是管理期貨CTA的長期觀察者和支持者，他認為「趨勢」策略是優秀的多樣化工具和尾部風險對沖工具。
- **正偏態和動態相關性：** 作者強調了趨勢策略的「正偏態」特徵，這意味著這些策略更有可能產生大幅正回報，而不是大幅負回報。而「動態相關性」則意味著這些策略與其他資產的相關性會隨著市場環境的變化而變化，這使得它們在市場動盪時期能夠提供有效的對沖。

總而言之，這段話指出，在當前市場環境下，傳統的避險工具久期不再有效，並引出了管理期貨CTA和趨勢策略作為替代方案，強調了這些策略在分散風險和對沖尾部風險方面的優勢。



The QIS piece punchline is something that heavily resonates with messages delivered here since the 2022 hiking cycle began, and again highlights this very-real issue for Investors who remain embedded in a “Duration as your Hedge” / “Old-world of Inflation & Fiscal Policy” perview…instead making the case for Interest Rate TREND allocation:



QIS研究報告的核心觀點與自2022年升息週期開始以來，此處（作者一直以來的觀點）傳達的訊息高度一致，並再次突顯了對於仍然深陷「以久期作為避險工具」/「舊世界通膨與財政政策」框架的投資者來說，一個非常實際的問題……該研究反而主張配置於利率趨勢：

這句話可以分解成以下幾個部分：

- **QIS研究的核心觀點與作者觀點一致：** 這表明作者和QIS研究團隊持有相似的市場觀點。
- **「以久期作為避險工具」的局限性：** 作者和QIS研究都認為，在當前市場環境下，傳統的避險工具——久期（通常指長天期債券）不再有效。這是因為當前的通膨和財政政策環境與過去不同，使得久期無法像以前那樣有效地對沖風險。
- **「舊世界通膨與財政政策」框架：** 這指的是過去幾十年中相對穩定的低通膨和可預測的財政政策環境，在這種環境下，久期可以有效地對沖利率風險。然而，現在的環境已經發生了變化。
- **主張配置於利率趨勢：** QIS研究報告建議，與其依賴久期，不如配置於利率趨勢策略。這意味著投資者應該關注利率的變動方向，並根據趨勢進行投資，而不是單純地持有長天期債券。

總而言之，這段話強調了在當前市場環境下，傳統的避險方式（即以久期作為避險工具）已經不再適用，並提出了配置於利率趨勢作為替代方案。這與作者自2022年以來一直強調的觀點相符。

Long-only fails when inflation is high,trend delivers  

# What faulty expectationsmean for asset allocation—-interestrate trend is a better diversifier for equities  

As interest rate trend outperforms long-only duration in risk-adjusted returns,it should come as no surprise that interest rate trend is a better match for long-only equities than the usual bond allocation. We can see this in the top left chart. The vertical blue bars represent large equity drawdowns over the sample period from 1988. The grey line shows the unfunded returns of the S&P 500 futures. The light blue line shows the unfunded returns of the US 10y Note futures. The red line shows the unfunded returns of a STIR trend strategy in USD. ·We can see that the interest rates trend strategyoutperformedUS 10y during the tech crash from 2000-2003 and during the inflation shock of 2022in particular.Wecan understand this betterby looking at the chart onthe topright, which shows the average dailyretuns during S&P500 drawdowns, but highlighting the difference between drawdowns when US inflation is less than $4\%$ (the blue bars) and greater than 4% (the red bars). Itis clear that long-only duration, the TY contract linked to $_{10y}$ futures, was only helpful when inflation was relatively low. When inflation was higher than $4\%$ , long-only duration was not helpful, losing money at the same time that SPX was in a drawdown. In contrast, USD rates trend made positive returns both when inflation was high and when it was low. In fact, even during the lower inflation period, USD rates trend outperformed long-only duration.

And FWIW, we see a similar but “REAL”Negative Gamma in said Al/ Chips -plays,e.g.SMH 3m Call Skew at 97%ile since 2011,which adds further “accelerant flow" potentials into rallies, due to hedging needs off the back of unabating “chase" demand for Upside Optionality in the Semis / Al -theme

This demand for Equities is then being somewhat offset on the Index level by Target Volatility “mechanical” sellling / deallocation (we estimate -\$60B SELLING of US Eq futures from Vol Control over the past month) off the back of the recent “true-in” in Realized Vol since mid December, with 1m SPX rVol going from 6-7 vols on 12/13/24 now to 15-16, which is the high for SPX trailing 1m rVol since the August "vVol / Tails Shock"
