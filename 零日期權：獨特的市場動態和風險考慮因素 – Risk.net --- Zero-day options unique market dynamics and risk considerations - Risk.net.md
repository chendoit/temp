Impact on market dynamics and trading strategies  
對市場動態和交易策略的影響

0DTE options – options contracts that expire on the same day they are traded – have surged in popularity in recent years, especially for S&P 500 contracts. Interest from retail traders, alongside institutional, proprietary and algorithmic traders, has fuelled growing interest in these ultra-short-dated options, which has had a significant impact on the volatility surface and structure of the market.  
0DTE 期權 – 在交易當天到期的期權合約 – 近年來越來越受歡迎，尤其是標準普爾 500 指數合約。散戶交易員以及機構、專有和演算法交易員的興趣推動了對這些超短期期權的興趣日益濃厚，這對市場的波動率表面和結構產生了重大影響。

Peng Cheng, managing director and head of big data and AI strategies at JP Morgan, observed that liquidity in S&P options has shifted from longer-dated to shorter-dated maturities, including 0DTEs: “There is a ‘liquidity begets liquidity’ phenomenon, which has prompted investors to reassess their maturity choices and engage in shorter-dated trading.”  
摩根大通董事總經理兼大數據和人工智慧策略主管彭程觀察到，標準普爾期權的流動性已從長期到期轉向短期到期，包括0DTE：“存在'流動性產生流動性'現象，這促使投資者重新評估他們的到期選擇並從事短期交易。

The experts noted a substitution effect, as some traders transition from longer‑dated options to 0DTEs. Whereas they may have traded one-year or six‑month options in the past, these traders are now trading one-month, one‑week or even one-day options instead. This migration may be driven by factors such as cost efficiency, tighter spreads and the ability to access the short-dated market’s higher liquidity with sophisticated execution algorithms.  
專家們注意到了替代效應，因為一些交易者從長期期權過渡到 0DTE。雖然他們過去可能交易的是一年或六個月的期權，但這些交易者現在交易的是一個月、一周甚至一天的期權。這種遷移可能是由成本效率、更小的點差以及通過複雜的執行演算法獲得短期市場更高流動性的能力等因素驅動的。

Cheng also noted potential substitution effects from S&P 500 E-mini futures contracts to 0DTE options contracts. Because S&P 500 options have a minimum tick size of $0.05, versus $0.25 for the E-minis, some algorithmic trading firms have switched to 0DTE options to benefit from the tight bid-offer spreads, as well as the deep liquidity. Cheng noted, however, that the transaction cost benefits of 0DTE options may be a misperception, as JP Morgan researchers discovered that E-mini futures actually have lower effective transaction costs on a delta-adjusted basis.  
Cheng 還指出了標準普爾 500 E-迷你期貨合約到 0DTE 期權合約的潛在替代效應。由於標準普爾 500 期權的最小最小變動價位為 0.05 美元，而 E-迷你期權的最小變動價位為 0.25 美元，因此一些演算法交易公司已轉向 0DTE 期權，以從低買賣價差以及深度流動性中受益。然而，Cheng 指出，0DTE 期權的交易成本優勢可能是一種誤解，因為摩根大通的研究人員發現，在 delta 調整的基礎上，E-mini 期貨實際上具有較低的有效交易成本。

Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, has observed a range of intraday strategies, but highlighted a mean reversion pattern, characterised by option buying in the morning to ‘fade’ – or trade against – the initial directional move, followed by selling in the afternoon. “This behaviour can mitigate intraday market moves and may lead retail traders \[looking to initially buy the dip or sell the rally\] to close options positions early to avoid being exercised into the underlying SPX or SPY positions,” he said.  
Susquehanna International Group 衍生品策略聯席主管 Chris Murphy 觀察了一系列盤中策略，但強調了均值回歸模式，其特徵是早上買入期權以“淡化”或逆勢交易最初的方向性走勢，然後在下午賣出。“這種行為可以緩解盤中市場的波動，並可能導致散戶交易者 \[希望最初逢低買入或賣出反彈\] 提前關閉期權頭寸，以避免被行使到標的 SPX 或 SPY 頭寸，”他說。

###   
Institutional use of 0DTE options and implications  
0DTE 選項的機構使用和影響

While many market pundits suggest that 0DTE options are used to hedge intraday risks, the panellists believed that 0DTEs are not extensively used for hedging purposes by institutional investors. This view was validated by an audience poll where only 6.6% of respondents said they use 0DTE options for hedging. Panellists noted that trading volumes of 0DTEs do not increase significantly during macro events or announcement days, suggesting that discretionary traders may not rely heavily on these options for hedging strategies. Instead, there seems to be a bias towards volatility capturing and directional trades, with a minor net selling bias prevailing in the market.  
雖然許多市場專家建議 0DTE 期權用於對沖盤中風險，但小組成員認為 0DTE 並未被機構投資者廣泛用於對沖目的。這一觀點得到了一項受眾民意調查的驗證，只有 6.6% 的受訪者表示他們使用 0DTE 選項進行對沖。小組成員指出，在巨集觀事件或公告日期間，0DTE 的交易量不會顯著增加，這表明自由裁量交易者可能不會嚴重依賴這些選項來制定對沖策略。相反，似乎存在對波動性捕捉和定向交易的偏見，市場上普遍存在輕微的凈賣出偏見。

Concerning risk premia capture, the panel highlighted the popularity of spreads – iron condors and put or call spreads – as popular trading strategies among retail traders. Retail traders often sell spreads to harvest premium while limiting total risk and avoiding large underlying positions. This spread trading behaviour also has implications for market-makers and can contribute to lower intraday volatility. It could also partly explain large 0DTE trading volumes, as the intraday buying and selling of each iron condor requires eight options contracts.  
關於風險溢價捕獲，小組強調了價差（鐵禿鷹和看跌或看漲價差）作為零售交易者中流行的交易策略的流行。散戶交易者經常賣出價差以獲得溢價，同時限制總風險並避免大量標的頭寸。這種價差交易行為也對做市商產生影響，並有助於降低盤中波動性。這也可以部分解釋大量的 0DTE 交易量，因為每隻鐵禿鷹的盤中買賣需要八份期權合約。

The panel also explored cross-asset considerations and relative value opportunities. They observed that the volatility term structure for S&P 500 options had been relatively steep in recent months, with short-term volatilities lower than long-term ones, and this can affect volatility surfaces across other asset classes.  
該小組還探討了跨資產考慮因素和相對價值機會。他們觀察到，近幾個月標準普爾 500 期權的波動率期限結構相對陡峭，短期波動率低於長期波動率，這可能會影響其他資產類別的波動率表面。

Amit Deshpande, head of quantitative investments and research at T. Rowe Price, noted that the behaviour of volatility in equities can influence other asset classes, such as high-yield or investment-grade bonds. He also noted that the short end of the volatility surface tended to fluctuate much more than the longer end, as options with 30 days to expiry or longer tended to stay relatively anchored. “These dynamics create tactical relative value opportunities but are dependent on episodic risks and events,” he said.  
T. Rowe Price 量化投資和研究主管 Amit Deshpande 指出，股票的波動行為會影響其他資產類別，例如高收益或投資級債券。他還指出，波動率表面的短端往往比長端波動大得多，因為距離到期日有 30 天或更長時間的期權往往保持相對錨定。“這些動態創造了戰術性的相對價值機會，但取決於偶發性風險和事件，”他說。

The discussion also touched on risk management considerations for market‑makers. While gamma risks exist due to directional flows, market-makers have adapted to the consistent volume of 0DTEs and assimilated the associated risks. The prevalence of spreads and the familiarity of market-makers with the flow patterns have aided this process.  
討論還涉及做市商的風險管理考慮因素。雖然定向流動存在伽馬風險，但做市商已經適應了 0DTE 的持續交易量並吸收了相關風險。價差的普遍性和做市商對流動模式的熟悉有助於這一過程。

Turning to analytics and modelling for 0DTEs, Russel Goyder, chief analytics officer at Numerix, said market participants must go beyond traditional pricing models because of the short time horizons involved. They have to rely on intuition, expert judgement and statistical analysis to navigate these options effectively, and trading can sometimes be more of an art than a science. Option Greeks, implied volatility and other pricing factors can provide a useful framework for understanding and managing risk. “However, more research is needed to develop models specifically tailored to intraday trading and volatility regimes,” said Goyder.  
談到 0DTE 的分析和建模，Numerix 首席分析官 Russel Goyder 表示，由於涉及的時間跨度短，市場參與者必須超越傳統的定價模型。他們必須依靠直覺、專家判斷和統計分析來有效地駕馭這些選項，而交易有時更像是一門藝術，而不是一門科學。期權希臘字母、隱含波動率和其他定價因素可以為理解和管理風險提供有用的框架。“然而，需要更多的研究來開發專門針對日內交易和波動率機制的模型，”Goyder 說。

Panellists noted that the Vix index, a popular volatility index introduced more than 30 years ago, remains a useful measure of market volatility despite the concentration of volume in 0DTEs. Goyder said the recently introduced one-day Vix index provides a useful daily indication of expected volatility, but noted that it requires interpretation in the context of the closing print. “It is quite coarse-grained and there are no directly equivalent option instruments that you can map it to, like you can for 30-day Vix, at least until there are intra‑hour expiries.”  
小組成員指出，Vix 指數是 30 多年前推出的流行波動率指數，儘管交易量集中在 0DTE 中，但它仍然是衡量市場波動性的有用指標。Goyder 表示，最近推出的單日 Vix 指數提供了預期波動性的有用每日指標，但指出它需要在收盤報告的背景下進行解釋。“它是相當粗粒度的，沒有直接等效的期權工具可以映射到它，就像 30 天 Vix 一樣，至少在小時內到期之前。”

Risk management considerations  
風險管理注意事項

Touching on the subject of risk management philosophy, Deshpande emphasised the unique characteristics of 0DTEs and the need to go beyond traditional pricing models: “Risk-defined strategies, such as condors or butterflies, are really important as they provide clear boundaries and maximum downsides that are known in advance.” He also recommended setting exposure limits based on total vega or net downside risk, as well as tightly managing positions throughout the day to stay within limits.  
談到風險管理理念的主題，Deshpande 強調了 0DTE 的獨特特徵以及超越傳統定價模型的必要性：「風險定義的策略，例如禿鷹或蝴蝶，非常重要，因為它們提供了明確的界限和事先知道的最大缺點。他還建議根據總 vega 或凈下行風險設置風險敞口，並全天嚴格管理頭寸以保持在限制範圍內。

The panellists suggested that the economic feasibility of intraday delta hedging for most users may be challenging, because of the high cost of continually paying bid-ask spreads. Cheng noted, however, that electronic market-makers, who benefit from the bid-ask advantage and execute large trading volumes, may have hedging flows that offset each other and may also delta hedge. “Other users such as high-frequency traders will probably not delta hedge, as they are likely using 0DTE options to trade directionally, or as a substitute for E-mini futures,” he said.  
小組成員認為，對於大多數用戶來說，日內 delta 對沖的經濟可行性可能具有挑戰性，因為持續支付買賣價差的成本很高。然而，Cheng 指出，受益於買賣優勢並執行大量交易量的電子做市商可能擁有相互抵消的對沖流量，也可能進行 delta 對沖。“其他使用者，如高頻交易者，可能不會進行 delta 對沖，因為他們可能會使用 0DTE 期權進行定向交易，或作為 E-mini 期貨的替代品，”他說。

Goyder emphasised the need for speed in monitoring intraday risks, recommending real-time monitoring of Greeks, open interest and volumes of out-of-the-money strikes. “It’s important to react quickly to potential crises or sharp market movements, as small intraday moves can escalate rapidly,” he explained.  
Goyder 強調需要快速監控盤中風險，建議即時監控希臘貨幣、未平倉合約和價外行權價的數量。“對潛在危機或劇烈的市場波動做出快速反應很重要，因為盤中小幅波動可能會迅速升級，”他解釋說。

Potential systemic risks and ‘Volmageddon’ concerns  
潛在的系統性風險和「Volmageddon」擔憂

[JP Morgan research](https://markets.jpmorgan.com/research/email/b21a3jsp/WecRcaUG6mAtbPv6WEqv_g/GPS-4338664-0) has brought attention to the possibility of systemic risks as a result of increased interest and positions in 0DTEs. The panellists discussed the possibility of a ‘Volmageddon 2.0’ and flash crashes, including potential transmission mechanisms.  
[摩根大通的研究](https://markets.jpmorgan.com/research/email/b21a3jsp/WecRcaUG6mAtbPv6WEqv_g/GPS-4338664-0)引起了人們對 0DTE 的興趣和頭寸增加導致系統性風險的可能性的關注。小組成員討論了“Volmageddon 2.0”和閃車的可能性，包括潛在的傳輸機制。

The analysis suggests that even though the buying and selling volumes in the 0DTE market may seem relatively balanced, there is actually a 2% net selling imbalance. This small imbalance can account for a substantial notional amount, given the large daily trading volumes. “A 2% imbalance on $500 billion notional traded each day results in a $10 billion imbalance,” Peng noted.  
分析表明，儘管 0DTE 市場的買賣量看起來相對平衡，但實際上存在 2% 的凈賣出不平衡。鑒於每日交易量很大，這種小的不平衡可以解釋相當大的名義金額。“每天 5000 億美元的名義交易 2% 的不平衡會導致 100 億美元的不平衡，”Peng 指出。

He added: “If short volatility sellers were to face an exogenous shock, unwinding their positions could lead to significant market impact due to the magnitude of delta to be unwound.” He suggested that a 1% downward move in the S&P 500, within a very short timeframe, such as five minutes, could lead to an additional 5% downward move, as short volatility sellers tried to exit or hedge their positions at the same time. This scenario could result in a significant decline in the market, similar to the one that occurred during Volmageddon in 2018.  
他補充說：「如果空頭波動率賣家面臨外生衝擊，由於 delta 的規模要平倉，平倉可能會導致重大市場影響。他建議，標準普爾 500 指數在很短的時間內（例如 5 分鐘）下跌 1% 可能會導致額外 5% 的下跌，因為空頭波動率賣家試圖同時退出或對沖他們的頭寸。這種情況可能會導致市場大幅下跌，類似於 2018 年 Volmageddon 期間發生的情況。

However, Murphy highlighted the difference between the current market dynamics and the original Volmageddon. In the lead-up, there had been several years of one-sided volatility selling, with record low volatilities, alongside leveraged short volatility ETFs containing large positions, which then imploded during Volmageddon. While the current volatility regime is somewhat low, the underlying market dynamics differ from the lead-up to Volmageddon. The nature of 0DTEs, with positions resetting each day, and the mixed dynamics of the market, mitigate the risks, he said. “However, if volatility remains low for an extended period and the selling of these options becomes a more popular strategy, the situation could change.”  
然而，Murphy 強調了當前市場動態與原始 Volmageddon 之間的差異。在此之前，出現了幾年的單邊波動率拋售，波動率創下歷史新低，同時包含大量頭寸的槓桿空頭波動率 ETF，然後在 Volmageddon 期間內爆。雖然目前的波動率水準較低，但潛在的市場動態與 Volmageddon 之前不同。他說，0DTEs 的性質，每天重置頭寸，以及市場的混合動態，降低了風險。“然而，如果波動性長時間保持低水準，並且出售這些期權成為一種更受歡迎的策略，情況可能會發生變化。”

The panellists discussed potential spillover effects to other markets and emphasised the presence of negative convexity in the market. They suggested that markets participants should monitor factors such as dealer gamma positioning, the distance and magnitude of dealers’ gamma flip from long to short, and the proximity to significant economic reports or events such as Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meetings, as they could potentially trigger market instability.  
小組成員討論了對其他市場的潛在溢出效應，並強調了市場中存在的負凸性。他們建議市場參與者應監控交易商的 gamma 定位、交易商從 long 到 short 的 gamma 翻轉的距離和幅度，以及與重要經濟報告或事件（如石油輸出國組織會議）的接近程度等因素，因為它們可能會引發市場不穩定。

Goyder noted that one-day Vix is not a useful metric for identifying volatility regime switches, which are crucial in predicting systemic risks such as these. “Volatility regime shifts are much easier to detect in historical time series data than they are to predict. This remains a challenging area which needs more research but, in the meantime, firms can track total gamma and dealer positioning derived from order flow models, which offer valuable indicators of risk.”  
Goyder指出，單日 Vix 不是識別波動率機制切換的有用指標，而波動率機制切換對於預測此類系統性風險至關重要。“在歷史時間序列數據中，波動率機制的變化比預測要容易得多。這仍然是一個具有挑戰性的領域，需要更多的研究，但與此同時，公司可以跟蹤從訂單流模型得出的總伽瑪和轉銷商頭寸，這些模型提供了有價值的風險指標。
