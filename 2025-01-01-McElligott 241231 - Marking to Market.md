Nomura Securities Intl Inc, Charlie McElligott, Equity Derivatives Sales / Strategy, 212 667 2210 This sales note is produced by Nomura Equities and is not a product of the Nomura Research Department  

A fair bit to update in the \~ two weeks since I last wrote, where like I always say, you never want to over-intrepret market moves into the year-end turn, with balance-sheet and risk capacity –constraints contributing to meaningful deterioration in liquidity and thus potentially “exaggerated optics” in price swings and themes…But yeah, these are not insignificant, and I do believe they might require some adjustments versus prior start of 2025 views on Positioning, Vol and Risks to Consensus Narratives thereafter  

在我上次寫這篇文章後的 ~ 兩周內，有相當多的更新，就像我經常說的那樣，你永遠不想過分誇大市場走勢進入年底，資產負債表和風險承受能力的限制導致流動性的實質性惡化，因此在價格波動和主題中可能“誇大其詞”......但是，是的，這些並非微不足道，我確實認為，與 2025 年初之前對定位、交易量和共識敘事風險的看法相比，它們可能需要進行一些調整

·         Over the past two weeks, USD Rates largely continued their relentless Term-Premium rebuild  after what was an initial start-of-Dec positioning Short Squeeze, with said TP reset resuming IMHO predominately a function of  1)   Market anticipation of shift back towards longer Duration Treasury issuance moving-forward again in  2025+  , and in-alignment with prior views of S Bessent and S Miran favoring a “terming-out” into Coupon while being critical at this point of further extention of the reliance on Bills at the same magnitude which the Yellen Treasury -regime shocked convention and has maintained since  (as well as simple realities / Fiscal expectations from Trump policy);  2)   Fed’s own uncertainty surrounding “upside risks” to their Core PCE projections with “sticky higher” inflation ; And  3)   Likelihood of a shallower Terminal Rate and higher Neutral Rate in that aforementioned context  

·在過去的兩周里，美元匯率在 12 月初最初的空頭擠壓頭寸之後，基本上繼續了無情的Term-Premium 重建，恕我直言，上述目標價重置恢復主要是

1) 市場預期從2025年起，可能重新轉向增加長期國債的發行量，這與此前S. Bessent和S. Miran的觀點相符，他們支持將短期債務延長至票息債（Coupon Bonds），並批評在當前階段繼續大幅依賴短期國庫券（Bills）的做法。這種依賴自耶倫（Yellen）主導的財政部時期以來已打破常規並持續至今，同時還反映了特朗普政策下的財政預期和現實情況；

2) 聯準會（Fed）對於其核心PCE（個人消費支出）預測中「上行風險」的不確定性，尤其是「黏性較高」的通脹；
3) 在上述背景下，終端利率（Terminal Rate）可能較低且中性利率（Neutral Rate）可能更高的可能性。

·         And for what’s generally been a BEAR-steepening in UST curves with the Long-End leading the selloff and accompanying higher USD, this has meant a substantial tightening of Financial Conditions,  which is evidencing itself both with US Economic Surprise indices nearing two month lows as data resumes missing on the margin vs expectations, in addition to seeing EM currencies now really coming-off sharply as well  (on top of “generic” implications of Trump tariff potentials)… all of which means a more precarious starting place for Risk despite the extremely constructive sentiment around US Economic prospects in light of policy tailwinds going-forward  
整體來看，美國國債收益率曲線（UST curves）出現了以長端領跌的熊市陡峭化（BEAR-steepening），伴隨著美元走強，這導致金融環境大幅收緊。這種收緊表現在以下幾個方面：美國經濟驚喜指數（Economic Surprise Index）接近兩個月低點，因數據逐漸未達預期；此外，新興市場（EM）貨幣也大幅下跌（再加上特朗普潛在關稅政策的「普遍性」影響）。所有這些因素表明，儘管未來政策利好帶來的美國經濟前景極其樂觀，==但風險資產的起點更加不穩定==。   Note: BEAR-steepening 是一種特殊的殖利率曲線變化，發生在熊市或經濟衰退預期下。它表示長期殖利率顯著上升，而短期殖利率相對穩定，通常被視為經濟即將復甦的信號。

·         Accordingly with the  crowded perception that Fed has little room to Cut in 2025 ,  clients are thinking about what could make that “go wrong” and increasingly poking-around on 2Y5Y UST Upside –expressions again in the case of economic downside surprise, and continuing to hedge for “Hard Landing” through Steepeners focused on Long-End  (5s30s / 10s30s)  
由於市場普遍認為聯準會（Fed）在2025年幾乎沒有降息空間，投資者開始思考哪些因素可能推翻這一認知，並越來越多地關注2年期至5年期美國國債（2Y5Y UST）的上行表現，特別是在經濟出現意外下行時。他們同時持續透過以長端（如5年-30年或10年-30年）為重點的陡峭化交易（Steepeners）對「硬著陸」（Hard Landing）進行對沖。

·         My early December messages in Equities were largely discussing the following themes :  1)  The impact of  “perpetual Index ATM Vol supply” from the VRP space   (and the Dealer “Long Gamma” from the large Sold Call from the Collar trade at SPX 6055),  which along with  2 ) the enormous Index “Correlation Crush” from the extreme “Bad Breadth” performance dispersion under the hood in Index  (extremely concentrated Mag8 “leadership” while everything else was chopping to nowhere)  that was then seeing  3)   the “De Facto Short Gamma” from the Leveraged ETF space and its own concentration of assets in MegaCap Tech –themes then further amplifying the dispersion and performance bifurcation , in-turn  4)   smashing Correlation and thus bleeding Equities Index Vols even further, as it was simply “so hard to move” under the weight of all that Dealer Gamma compressing the daily distribution  

在12月初的股票市場（Equities）分析中，我主要討論了以下主題：

1. **“指數永久ATM波動率供應”（Perpetual Index ATM Vol supply）的影響**：來自VRP（波動率風險溢價）領域，尤其是經銷商（Dealer）因大規模的賣出認購選擇權（Sold Call）Collar交易而處於「長Gamma」（Long Gamma）狀態，特別是在標普500指數（SPX）6055的情況下；
2. **指數“相關性崩潰”（Correlation Crush）**：由於極端的「壞市場廣度」（Bad Breadth）表現分化造成的影響。指數內部呈現極高的表現分散性，主要由「Mag8」（領頭的八大科技巨頭）極度集中的領導地位驅動，而其他股票則幾乎沒有明顯趨勢；
3. **槓桿ETF領域的“事實上的短Gamma”（De Facto Short Gamma）**：資產集中於大型科技股（MegaCap Tech）主題，進一步放大了分散性和表現的兩極化；
4. **相關性崩潰進一步壓低指數波動率（Index Vols）**：由於經銷商Gamma的壓縮效應，日內價格分布變得更加平緩，使得在這種沉重的Gamma壓力下指數移動變得「非常困難」，進一步削弱了股票指數的波動性。

 $^+$  
·           Cumulatively, these effects substantially weighed on SPX Index trailing realized Vol, then facilitating  what was  5) a massive Exposure re-accumulation Vol-sensitive Systematic strats i.e. the 99%ile  (3Y lookback)  Vol Control Equities allocation made by mid December …  

·           But this backdrop was also  6) one which would then create the conditions to see said Target Volatility –funds becoming large mechanical SELLERS in the case of a Vol squeeze catalyst…and finally too, then 7) risk feeding into further Vol and Vol of Vol repricing higher, thanks to the extremely trending VIX Upside Call / Call Spread buying as the market’s preferred calamity hedge out into Jan / Feb expiration s, which along with some consistent programmatic buying of Wingy Downside SPX “Crash” Puts  (Dealers Short)  and AUM Growth of the “Short Vol” –side of the Leveraged VIX ETN complex was creating some real tension in the US Equities Options –space ,  with medium term trailing VIX Beta to Spot ratcheting to not just local highs but multi-year highs and signaling potential for stress, with Skew and VVIX jacking back into “pucker” territory with Dealers and Leveraged VIX ETNs needing to buy a lot of Vega in the case of further Spot VIX rally  

總體來看，這些影響大幅壓低了標普500指數（SPX）的過去實現波動率（trailing realized Vol），進一步促成了以下幾點：

1. **波動敏感型系統化策略的巨量頭寸重新累積**：例如，至12月中旬達到99%分位數（3年回顧期）的波動率控制（Vol Control）股票配置；
   => ==這表示vol 到達一個很低的位置, 也就是到達一個極端==
2. **市場條件的轉變**：上述背景也為目標波動率（Target Volatility）基金在波動率擠壓（Vol squeeze）催化劑出現時成為大規模的機械性賣家創造了條件；===> 在這種情形下 很容易開始Vol 波動 (增加)==
3. **進一步推高波動率及波動率的波動（Vol of Vol）重定價風險**：這主要歸因於市場偏好將VIX上行買權/買權價差（Call/Call Spread）作為1月至2月到期的災難對沖手段，同時伴隨著一些一致性程序性購買遠端下行（Wingy Downside）SPX「崩盤」認沽期權（Crash Puts）（經銷商處於賣方），以及槓桿型VIX ETN（交易所交易票據）空波動策略資產管理規模（AUM）的增長。這些因素在美國股票期權領域引發了真正的緊張局勢。

此外，中期過去的VIX與現貨（Spot）相關性（Beta）不僅上升至局部高點，甚至達到了多年高位，顯示出壓力的潛在可能性。同時，Skew（波動率偏斜）和VVIX（波動率的波動率指數）重新攀升至「緊張」區域，暗示如果現貨VIX進一步上漲，經銷商及槓桿型VIX ETN將需要大量購買Vega（波動率敞口），進一步加劇市場波動的風險。

·           And with these sudden deal location and de leveraging flows tilting broad Equities supply / demand –dynamics with actual SELL pressure, that prior a mpl if ici ation to the Equities Upside move from Leveraged ETF product’s end of day rebalancing flows then too began turning an end of day SELL flow as well   (as again, this “Synthetic Short Gamma” will cut both ways),  with the cumulative notionals being large enough to blow through what had been the enormous Dealer “Long Gamma” of the 6055 strike,   now well below that level and into actual a local “Short Gamma” territory  (FWIW, the Collar re-strike / roll with trade today, with \~ -\$10-11B of Delta for sale into an illiquid NYE market, which is probably being “front-run” now)  

由於突然的交易重新定位（deal location）和去槓桿化資金流（de-leveraging flows），廣泛的股票市場供需動態被傾斜，實際的賣壓出現。此前槓桿ETF產品因日終再平衡資金流所放大的股票上漲行情，現在也開始轉變為日終賣壓（SELL flow）。這一現象再一次證明，這種「合成短Gamma」（Synthetic Short Gamma）會產生雙向效應。

累積的名義金額（notionals）足夠大，已經突破此前在6055價位的巨大經銷商「長Gamma」（Long Gamma）防線，目前已經遠低於該水準，進入了當前的「短Gamma」（Short Gamma）區域。

**額外信息**：值得一提的是（FWIW），Collar交易今天進行了重新設定和展期（re-strike / roll），涉及約-$10至-$11B的Delta拋售，恰逢流動性較低的元旦前市場（NYE market）。這可能已經被市場提前消化（“front-run”）了。

·           Index Vols have held higher with VIX implying meaningfully larger daily ranges, while Skew and Put Skew steepened out nicely as we’ve finally “realized” the ability to selloff and move lower, then eliciting more Equities Index  (Downside)  hedging demand from Buyside who’s been quite Long / high Exposure, which in-turn maintains the risk of “Downside accelerant flow” from Dealer hedging into a further Spot selloff  指數波動率（Index Vols）保持較高水準，VIX暗示日內波動範圍顯著擴大。同時，Skew（波動率偏斜）和Put Skew（認沽期權偏斜）明顯陡峭化，這反映出市場終於「實現」了向下修正的能力並開始下跌。這引發了買方（Buyside）的更多股票指數下行對沖需求，他們此前一直處於相當長期、多頭倉位或高風險曝險狀態。

這種需求反過來也增加了經銷商（Dealer）對現貨（Spot）進一步拋售的對沖壓力，從而維持了「下行加速資金流」（Downside accelerant flow）的風險，可能進一步加劇市場的下跌動能。

·           So from here, it’s strill a somewhat treacherous “push / pull,” as indicated by Vol and Vol of Vol VVIX signaling more-of-the-same ongoing “tension” I was ironically highlighting before I left—a.k.a. “running to stand still”:  

從目前情況看，市場仍處於一種相當危險的「拉鋸戰」（push/pull）狀態，這從波動率（Vol）和波動率的波動（Vol of Vol，VVIX）的指標中得以印證。VVIX繼續顯示出與此前相似的持續「緊張」狀態，這也正如我在離開前諷刺性提到的情況——也就是「奔跑卻停在原地」（“running to stand still”）。

o     Eq iVol is indeed screening as “rich” per the backtest, and we’re seeing resumption of Options Selling with incresed enthusiasm again at these more attractive entry point  
股票隱含波動率（Eq iVol）根據回測結果確實顯示出「高估」（“rich”）的特徵。在這些更具吸引力的切入點上，我們觀察到選擇權賣方的活動正以更高的熱情重新活躍起來，表明市場參與者對當前定價的興趣增加。

o     Post the said Vol control flow shift noted above, we’ve now “cleared” a huge chunk of that precariously “Long” Systematic Exposure, and now into a much cleaner place from the “Mechanical” Vol-Sensitive allocaton strategy universe  

在上述波動率控制（Vol control）資金流轉變之後，我們已經「清理」了那部分令人擔憂的龐大「多頭」系統化曝險。當前的市場環境對於「機械性」波動敏感配置策略來說，已進入一個更為乾淨和健康的位置，減少了潛在的風險積累。

o     New year, new PNL and risk-budget, new willingness to allocate into “high Sharpe” Short Vol VRP –strats  

新的一年，新的盈虧（PNL）和風險預算，以及對於將資金配置到「高夏普比率」（High Sharpe）短期波動風險溢價（Short Vol VRP）策略的更高意願，顯示出市場參與者在調整其投資策略以應對新的一年挑戰的同時，對低波動、穩健回報的策略更加青睞。

o     And all of this  should  then lean-into that noted “Extreme Spot / VIX Beta” to then relax the tension, see Dealer Gamma fill-back-in from Options VRP players / Premium Income strats, compress rVol, then allowing for Exposure to be re accumulated in the classic “Virtuous Cycle” of modern market structure  
所有這些應該會進一步促進前述的「極端現貨/VIX Beta」，從而緩解市場的緊張情緒，讓經銷商的Gamma回補，並吸引來自選擇權風險溢價（Options VRP）玩家和保費收入策略（Premium Income strategies）的資金流入，最終壓縮實現波動率（rVol）。這將為再度累積曝險提供空間，形成當代市場結構中的經典「良性循環」（Virtuous Cycle）

o     BUT…this is happening concurrent to  Spot Equities in the last day of the year now continuing to push deeper into Dealer “Short Gamma” territory   (with vast majority of the recent “Long Gamma” insulation then coming off after today / this Friday expiry)   and larger daily ranges which are going to continue dragging-UP trailing rVol … and in a world where “Volatility is Your Exposure Toggle” off of what had been recently high Net Leverage and Allocations, this will act to constrain Exposures at the same time   in the opposite “Vicious Cycle”  

然而，這一過程正同時發生，尤其是在年末的最後一天，現貨股票市場繼續推進至經銷商的「短Gamma」區域（Short Gamma territory），近期大部分的「長Gamma」防範措施在今天或這個星期五的期權到期後將被解除。同時，較大的日內波動範圍將繼續推升過去的實現波動率（rVol），並進一步拖累它的走勢。

在一個「波動率是你曝險調節開關」的世界中，這種情況發生在近期高度淨槓桿（Net Leverage）和資金配置（Allocations）下，將在相反的「惡性循環」（Vicious Cycle）中限制曝險的積累。這意味著市場將面臨相互對立的力量，一方面是放鬆的波動性驅動，另一方面是來自高波動率的曝險調整壓力。

IF WE MAINTAIN THIS RECENT  $\uparrow\%$   DAILY SPX CHANGE ENVIRONMENT,  STILL SEEING \~-\$28B OF POTENTIAL VOL CONTROL SELLING IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS… BUT IF WE RE-COMPRESS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF “LONG GAMMA” FROM OPTIONS SELLERS INTO THE NEW YEAR, THERE WOULD BE A LOT EQUITIES TO BUY LOOKINGOUT ON THE 1 MONTH FORWARD PROJECTED TIME HORIZON:  

如果我們保持近期的日常標普500指數（SPX）變動環境，仍然預計在接下來的兩週內可能會出現約-280億美元的波動率控制賣盤（Vol Control Selling）。但如果在新的一年裡，選擇權賣方的「長Gamma」進一步壓縮市場，則有可能在接下來的一個月前景中出現大量的股票買入機會。這意味著，如果市場能夠在高波動性的情況下回穩，將會有大量的資金流入，尤其是在向前看一個月的時間範圍內，這可能會成為一個有利的入場時機。
