Specifically, it reads a given question as input and produces a corresponding category or label based on the content of the question. Here's how the program goes about solving this task: 1. **Definition of Input and Output Fields**: - The `QuestionLabel` function defends the input and output fields. The `question` field is marked as required and is described as \"The input question to be categorized\". - The `answer` field is also required and is intended to hold the categorized label or category for the corresponding question. 2. **Module Initialization**: - The `\n",

It aims to assign a specific label or category to a given input question. This can be particularly useful in tasks such as sentiment analysis, intention detection, topic categorization, or any other scenario where understanding the context or type of a question is critical. Here's how the program works: 1. **QuestionLabel Definition**: - This is a structured format with input and output fields defined. The input field is `question` which is a required string, described as \"The input question to be categorized\" with a prefix \"Question:\". - The output field is `answer`, also a required string, described as \"The\n",
